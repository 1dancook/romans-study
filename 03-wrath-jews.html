<p class="admonition-title">Romans 2:1-3:8 (ESV)</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>  Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. <strong>2</strong> We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things. <strong>3</strong> Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God? <strong>4</strong> Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? <strong>5</strong> But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.  </p>
<p><strong>6</strong> He will render to each one according to his works: <strong>7</strong> to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; <strong>8</strong> but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. <strong>9</strong> There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, <strong>10</strong> but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. <strong>11</strong> For God shows no partiality.  </p>
<p><strong>12</strong> For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. <strong>13</strong> For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. <strong>14</strong> For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. <strong>15</strong> They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them <strong>16</strong> on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.  </p>
<p><strong>17</strong> But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God <strong>18</strong> and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; <strong>19</strong> and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, <strong>20</strong> an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth— <strong>21</strong> you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? <strong>22</strong> You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <strong>23</strong> You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. <strong>24</strong> For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”  </p>
<p><strong>25</strong> For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. <strong>26</strong> So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? <strong>27</strong> Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. <strong>28</strong> For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. <strong>29</strong> But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.  </p>
<p><strong>3:1</strong>  Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? <strong>2</strong> Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. <strong>3</strong> What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? <strong>4</strong> By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written,  </p>
<p>“That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.”  </p>
<p><strong>5</strong> But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) <strong>6</strong> By no means! For then how could God judge the world? <strong>7</strong> But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? <strong>8</strong> And why not do evil that good may come?—as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.  </p>
