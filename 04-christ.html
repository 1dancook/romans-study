<div class="admonition scripture">
<p class="admonition-title">Romans 3:1-31 (ESV)</p>
<p><strong>3:1</strong>  Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? <strong>2</strong> Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. <strong>3</strong> What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? <strong>4</strong> By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written,  </p>
<p>“That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.”  </p>
<p><strong>5</strong> But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) <strong>6</strong> By no means! For then how could God judge the world? <strong>7</strong> But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? <strong>8</strong> And why not do evil that good may come?—as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.  </p>
<p><strong>9</strong> What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, <strong>10</strong> as it is written:  </p>
<p>“None is righteous, no, not one; <strong>11</strong> no one understands; no one seeks for God. <strong>12</strong> All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.” <strong>13</strong> “Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.” “The venom of asps is under their lips.” <strong>14</strong> “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.” <strong>15</strong> “Their feet are swift to shed blood; <strong>16</strong> in their paths are ruin and misery, <strong>17</strong> and the way of peace they have not known.” <strong>18</strong> “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”  </p>
<p><strong>19</strong> Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. <strong>20</strong> For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.  </p>
<p><strong>21</strong> But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— <strong>22</strong> the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: <strong>23</strong> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, <strong>24</strong> and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, <strong>25</strong> whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. <strong>26</strong> It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.  </p>
<p><strong>27</strong> Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. <strong>28</strong> For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. <strong>29</strong> Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, <strong>30</strong> since God is one—who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. <strong>31</strong> Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.  </p>

<h3 id="observations-and-notes">Observations and Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The issue here is that Israel was unfaithful to the covenant, not that God was unfaithful.</li>
<li>3:4 - "By no means!" is shows the absurdity of the opposing objection. </li>
<li>3:4 - the quote is from Psalm 51:4 in which David confesses and reflects on his sin of adultery with Bathsheba. God is justified in judging sin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="questions-and-application">Questions and Application</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the previous lessons we see that all are under God's wrath. What advantage do the Jews have?</p>
<ul>
<li>3:2 - they were <code>entrusted with the oracles of God</code>. They were given the revelation of God. </li>
<li><strong>Romans 9:4</strong> (ESV) <em>They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the unfaithfulness of people make God unfaithful?</p>
<ul>
<li>The answer is an obvious no, but think about the issue for a moment. There are often times that people have issues in their life and may blame God - implying that he wasn't faithful. </li>
<li>Do you blame God for your own unfaithfulness?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does it mean <code>our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God</code>?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>righteousness of God</em> refers to his justice </li>
<li>God will judge sin and in the act of judging reveals more about who he is. Therefore there is some good that comes out of our evil. </li>
<li>The question then becomes - if my sinful living is giving God glory, why would I be condemned for that? Isn't it a good result?</li>
<li>There is a line of thinking that goes like this: <em>"God is in control of everything. Even my evil will ultimately demonstrate His righteousness. Therefore God is unjust if He inflicts His wrath on me, because I'm just a pawn in His hand."</em></li>
<li>A person is not given credit for doing evil - even if God brought some good out of their evil. That person still stands guilty before God. </li>
<li><em>Note: 3:8 - if some are teaching "do evil so that good will come" then condemnation for that teaching is just.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="39-18-hammering-the-point-with-scripture">3:9-18 Hammering the Point with Scripture</h2>
<p>Paul strings together some texts (refered to as "pearl stringing") to bring home the points he has been making. Stringing together texts like this was common in the opening of synagogue homilies and also evidenced in the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>

<li>3:9 - <code>What then?</code> is a common rhetorical question that is used to advance the argument in a diatribe.</li>
<li>3:9 - being 'under' sin is synonymous with being under its rule.</li>
<li>It may be intentional that Paul mentions more things here about 'mouth' related issues (3:13-14). It's potentially related to the Roman Christians complaining about each other (Romans 14).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="questions-and-application_1">Questions and Application</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What does it mean that "both Jews and Greeks" are "under sin"? (3:9)</p>
<ul>
<li>Being 'under' means being 'ruled'. Jews and Gentiles together are under the <em>rule</em> of sin. This speaks of being in slavery to sin and having the inability to break free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul strings together different scriptures in 3:10-18 to further the point that "all are under sin".</p>
<ul>
<li>Quotes from: <ul>
<li>Psalm 14:1-3</li>
<li>Psalm 5:9</li>
<li>Psalm 140:3</li>
<li>Psalm 10:7</li>
<li>Isaiah 59:7-8</li>
<li>Psalm 36:1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are some big points here?<ul>
<li>No one is righteous</li>
<li>No one understands</li>
<li>No one seeks God</li>
<li>All have turn aside</li>
<li>All have become worthless (together)</li>
<li>No one does good</li>

<li>Everyone's actions bring about bloodshed, ruin and misery.</li>
<li>No one knows the way of peace.</li>
<li>No one fears God.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is a swift condemnation of all people. If anyone thinks they have some semblance of goodness, these verses would shut them up.</li>
<li>What body parts do you see mentioned? Why is there so much mention of body parts?<ul>
<li>Throat, tongue, lips, mouth, feet, eyes.</li>
<li>Jewish teachers emphasized that evil ruled body parts.</li>

<h2 id="319-31-the-righteousness-of-god-revealed">3:19-31 The Righteousness of God Revealed</h2>
<p>A Jewish reader might contend with the point that all are sinners by saying that he is justified by the works of the law. Paul's writing here shows again that Jews and Gentiles are on the same level ground. God's righteousness is not moved or swayed by one's obedience to the law (Jew) or even by one's disobedience (Gentile). It is instead received by faith in Christ and this is for both the Jew and the Gentile.</p>
<h3 id="observations-and-notes_2">Observations and Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>3:21 - <code>But now...</code> indicates a big shift in Paul's argument.</li>
<li>3:21 - <code>the Law and the Prophets</code> indicates whole Old Testament</li>
<li>3:23 - <code>fall short of the glory of God</code> may be about the Jewish idea that when Adam sinned, humanity lost the glory of God (and so each generation repeates Adam's sin). It could also simply mean that no one lives up to God's standards.</li>
<li>3:27 - <code>boasting</code> is about the Jews being able to boast about salvation and having something better or more than Gentiles.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="questions-and-application_2">Questions and Application</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Jew might counter Paul's point that "all are under sin" by saying "But I am justified by the law." How does Paul counter that point in 3:19-20?</p>
<ul>
<li>The law speaks to those under (ruled by) the law and does not provide any excuse. Instead it holds all the world accountable to God. </li>
<li>Obedience to the law cannot justify someone before God because it points out sin. The law was never intended as a means of salvation or justification. </li>
<li>Since the Jew cannot be justified by the law, it points to a much greater need</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think that obedience to the 'law' or 'rules' found throughout the Bible will justify you before God? </p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes Christians feel as though they need good works to feel justified before God. They don't want to feel the weight of guilt for their sin and then turn to good works in an attempt to justify themselves. This is not possible to do, even though many try.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is meant by the <code>righteousness of God</code> in 3:21-26?</p>
<ul>
<li>This was also mentioned in 1:17 and it is about how God treats the sinner as if he had not been a sinner at all. It is his vindication of the sinner.</li>
<li>It is all about the work of Jesus Christ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is God's righteousness revealed?</p>
<ul>
<li>All that is written and spoken in the Old Testament law and the prophets is not able to vindicate a person. It shows the reader that they cannot rely on the law for justification. </li>
<li>Instead, the law and the prophets point to how God's righteousness is revealed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is God's righteousness received? </p>
<ul>
<li>3:22 - it is through faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the object of faith here.</li>
<li>3:24-25 - it is a gift that is received by faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does God's righteousness do for the recipient (3:24-25)?</p>
<ul>
<li>The recipient is <strong>justified by his grace</strong>. <ul>
<li><em>"Justification"</em> is a court term. Sinners stand before God the Judge as condemned. Those who have faith in what Jesus has done are justified. By his gift of grace God declares believers "not guilty".</li>
<li>A persons 'good work' has no merit here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The recipient is <strong>redeemed</strong>.<ul>
<li><em>"Redemption"</em> is a term from the slave market and an Old Testament concept. To free a slave or to get something back always required paying a price. </li>
<li>Christians are purchased by God. They are freed from being slaves to sin. The price was the death of Christ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The recipient is <strong>propitiated for by Jesus' blood</strong> <ul>
<li><em>"Propitiation"</em> is a term that is borrowed from temple rituals. It is used to refer to the act of sacrificing an animal on behalf of someone. This act would turn away God's wrath. </li>
<li>The mercy seat (the cover of the ark of the covenant) was all about propitiation. God's mercy was found in the holy of holies but it required the right sacrifice/blood. There had to be a satisfactory sacrifice. This was necessary for reconiliation between people and God. (God passing over sins before is in anticipation of the work of Jesus on the cross)</li>
<li>Jesus came under God's wrath on our behalf and his wrath is satisfied. His wrath against us is therefore turned away because of Jesus' blood. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who can receive God's righteousness?</p>
<ul>
<li>3:22 - <code>all who believe</code>, <code>there is no distinction</code> shows that this is for both the Jew and the Gentile - anyone who will receive Jesus by faith</li>
<li>3:30 - both Jew and Gentile can be justified by faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone might say, "if the law can't justify us, then we don't need it!". Does the way that God's righteouesness is revealed in the gospel destroy the law?</p>
<ul>
<li>3:31 - No. Paul uses the next part to show why - the gospel establishes the law, fulfilling its own predictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
