<div class="admonition scripture">
<p class="admonition-title">Romans 4:1-25 (ESV)</p>
<p><strong>4:1</strong>  What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? <strong>2</strong> For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. <strong>3</strong> For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” <strong>4</strong> Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. <strong>5</strong> And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, <strong>6</strong> just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:  </p>
<p><strong>7</strong> “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; <strong>8</strong> blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.”  </p>
<p><strong>9</strong> Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. <strong>10</strong> How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. <strong>11</strong> He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, <strong>12</strong> and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.  </p>
<p><strong>13</strong> For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. <strong>14</strong> For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. <strong>15</strong> For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.  </p>
<p><strong>16</strong> That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, <strong>17</strong> as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. <strong>18</strong> In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.” <strong>19</strong> He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. <strong>20</strong> No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, <strong>21</strong> fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. <strong>22</strong> That is why his faith was “counted to him as righteousness.” <strong>23</strong> But the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake alone, <strong>24</strong> but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, <strong>25</strong> who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. </p>

<ul>
<li>up until now Paul has been making the point that all people are under sin, even the Jews, and that to be justified one must have faith in Christ.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="abraham-made-righteous-by-faith">Abraham Made Righteous by Faith</h2>
<h3 id="observations-and-notes">Observations and Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abraham was considered a gentile before his circumcision. (relevant to verse 9-12)</li>
<li>Jewish readers would have believed they were chosen in Abraham and that all Israelites would be saved by God's grace if they maintained the covenant.</li>
<li>Gentiles who converted to Judaism had to be circumcised and also obey all the law.</li>
<li>This is a kind of commentary on Genesis 15:6 and reinforcing the point from 3:21-31 that the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Genesis 15:6</strong>
<strong>6</strong> And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.  </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If anyone was righteous in Jewish tradition, it was surely Abraham.</li>
<li>the <code>blessing</code> in verse 9 is expounding on the quote from Psalm 32:1-2 in v7-8.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="questions-and-application">Questions and Application</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is "faith" a work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Jewish teachers often commented on Abraham's faith as reflected in Genesis 15:6, which they read as "faithfulness," one of his works</li>
<li>Paul looks at this in context and uses a bookkeeping term to show that God has credited righteousness. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abraham was made righteous by faith over thirteen years before he was circumcised. Why is this important?</p>
<ul>
<li>This fact challenged the great significance Judaism gave to circumcision</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does Paul put Gentile Christians on the same level as Jewish Christians?</p>
<ul>
<li>He does. His argument shows that even though circumcision is a sign of the covenant, Abraham's circumcision is a sign of his prior righteousness.</li>
<li>Those who are made righteous by faith are heirs of Abraham (as opposed to the idea that it is only the circumcised that are heirs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reading 4:16-22, how can you describe <code>faith</code>?</p>
<ul>
<li>not passive assent to what God says</li>
<li>faith is enduring dependence on God's promise, even to the point of staking your life on it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does your walk with God compare to Abraham's example of faith?</p>
</li>
</ol>
