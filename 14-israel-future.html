<div class="admonition scripture">
<p class="admonition-title">Romans 11:1-36 (ESV)</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>  I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. <strong>2</strong> God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? <strong>3</strong> “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.” <strong>4</strong> But what is God's reply to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” <strong>5</strong> So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. <strong>6</strong> But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.  </p>
<p><strong>7</strong> What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, <strong>8</strong> as it is written,  </p>
<p>“God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.”  </p>
<p><strong>9</strong> And David says,  </p>
<p>“Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them; <strong>10</strong> let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever.”  </p>
<p><strong>11</strong> So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. <strong>12</strong> Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!  </p>
<p><strong>13</strong> Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry <strong>14</strong> in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. <strong>15</strong> For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? <strong>16</strong> If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.  </p>
<p><strong>17</strong> But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, <strong>18</strong> do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. <strong>19</strong> Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” <strong>20</strong> That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear. <strong>21</strong> For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. <strong>22</strong> Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. <strong>23</strong> And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. <strong>24</strong> For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.  </p>
<p><strong>25</strong> Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. <strong>26</strong> And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written,  </p>
<p>“The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”; <strong>27</strong> “and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.”  </p>
<p><strong>28</strong> As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. <strong>29</strong> For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. <strong>30</strong> For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, <strong>31</strong> so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. <strong>32</strong> For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.  </p>
<p><strong>33</strong> Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!  </p>
<p><strong>34</strong> “For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?” <strong>35</strong> “Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?”  </p>
<p><strong>36</strong> For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.  </p>
