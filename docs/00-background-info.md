## Context: Questions to think about

!!! Warning "Context"
    Remember that the context for Romans is important for understanding what it is about. Without understanding the context of the writer and the recipients, it is difficult to make sense and interpret correctly what is written.

Read the entire letter. 

1. Who wrote this letter? 
2. Who is this letter written to? 
3. What is the situation of the recipients (that you can gather from this letter)? 
4. What is the situation of the author?
5. Why did the Paul write this letter? 


## Pertinent Background Information

### Preliminary Information:
- **Author**: Paul
- **Date**: Around 53-58 A.D.
- **Location of Writing**: (highly likely) from the city of Corinth as he was there on his third missionary journey (Acts 20:2-3). 
- This was written quite later in his career (after about 20 years of ministry)
- Paul knew that he likely would not have been able to visit the church in Rome even though he intended to. After writing the letter and visiting Jerusalem, he faced problems there that prevented him from travel. So this letter is thorough in explanation of the Gospel in order to prevent misunderstanding.

### Church in Rome
- The church in Rome (Acts 18:1-2) had existed for some time and was made up of Jewish and non-Jewish followers of Jesus
- At one point the Emperor Claudius expelled all Jewish people from Rome. 5 years later (when Claudius died) all of those Jews (also Jewish Christians) were allowed to return
- When they returned, there was division in the church. The Gentile's expression of Christian faith had grown more and more dissimilar to the Jewish Christians.  Disagreements arose about circumcision/sabbath/food etc. 
- Certain aspects of the letter address the Jewish Christians while other aspects address the Gentile Christians

### Purpose of Writing and Other Notes
- Paul wanted the divided Church to be unified
- Romans is the fullest explanation of the gospel - the good news about Jesus' life, death and resurrection
- It is the longest letter written by Paul
- Romans is very significant for Christian history (Martin Luther and the Reformation - *sola fide*)
- There are four main parts to the letter - but they are unified as one big explanation of the gospel
