# Introduction (Romans 1:1-17)

### Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Romans 1:1-17 (ESV)"
    **1**  Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, **2** which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, **3** concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh **4** and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, **5** through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, **6** including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,  
    
    **7** To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints:  
    
    Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
    
    **8** First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. **9** For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you **10** always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you. **11** For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you— **12** that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine. **13** I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. **14** I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. **15** So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.  
    
    **16** For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. **17** For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”  


## Introduction (1:1-7)

### Observations and Notes

**Question:** What do you observe?

- 1:1 `a servant (or slave) of Christ` - a slave of someone in high position had higher social status than that of a commoner. The idea behind the word servant/slave (doulos) is complete devotion.
- 1:1 `called` - the term has connections to the Old Testament idea of the Israelites being called to be his own people. In this case it is even more specific- just as prophets of the Old Testament were called.  
- 1:4 `Spirit of holiness` - common Jewish name for the Holy Spirit. 
- 1:3-4 `Son of God` for Roman pagans could strike them as portraying Jesus as a rival to the emporer. Jesus' humanity and divinity are confirmed here: `descended from David` and `Son of God`
- 1:6-7 `called` - these Christians in Rome are equivalent in mission to Paul who is called. 
- 1:7 Jesus and God are equal in providing grace and peace
- 1:7 `grace` comes from a common greek greeting and `peace` is a usual way that Jews greet each other. Paul turns common greetings into a desire for blessing.

### Questions and Application
1. What does this tell us about the Gospel?
    - 1:1 it is God's gospel (not Paul's or someone else's)
    - 1:1-2 it was promised beforehand
    - 1:1-4 it is about Jesus (death/resurrection)

2. Why is Paul qualified to spread the gospel? What qualifies a person or what is required to proclaim the Gospel? Are you qualified to proclaim the Gospel?

## Paul's Thanksgiving (1:8-17)

**Question** What do you observe in this passage?

### Observations and Notes
- 1:8 the church in Rome had a special opportunity because of location to be visible throughout the Empire
- 1:9 `with my spirit` is better translated in common English as `with all my heart`
- 1:10 Devout Jewish people might spend several hours a day in prayer
- 1:10 Paul eventually made it to Rome but not in a way he expected (see the last part of Acts)
- 1:11-12 Paul writes that he wants to see them and this is a conventional matter to mention in ancient letters. It conveys a sense of being present even though far apart
- 1:14 `barbarians` is 'non-Greeks' to the Greeks. Greeks also considered themselves wise and everyone else foolish.
- 1:17 the quote is from Habakkuk 2:4. In context the righteous are those who survive the judgement because they have faith. This is not a passive faith but a faith that has an affect on someone's lifestyle. Paul used this to mean that those who trust in Christ are saved from final judgement.
- 1:17 the Romans thought they were powerful, but they had no power in terms of salvation.  
- 1:17 `from faith to faith` is probably "by faith from beginning to end". Receiving the gospel is by faith. Continuing with God is by faith.


### Questions and Application
1. Why does Paul want to visit the Christians in Rome?
    - `impart some spiritual gift to strengthen you` further defined: `we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith` (v11-12)
    - `reap some harvest` (v13)

2. What do we learn about the gospel according to v16-17?
    - `it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes`
    - it is for all people
    - it reveals the righteousness of God

3. What is meant by `righteousness of God` here (v17)?
    - this is about God justifying people (legal vindication) 
    - it shows that God is just
    - it also shows that he is faithful to his promises
    - the sense of the greek word used for is that God treats the sinner as if he had not been a sinner at all. This is the righteousness of God revealed in the gospel.
    - you can be assured that the way God views you and treats you as a believer is as if you had never sinned

4. Why is Paul not ashamed of the gospel? Are you ashamed of the Gospel? If you are ashamed, how can you become unashamed?

5. Paul is eager to preach the gospel. How about you? Is there anything that holds you back from sharing the gospel?
