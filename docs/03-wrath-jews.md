# God's Wrath against Moralists and Jews (2:1-29)

### Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Romans 2:1-29 (ESV)"
    **1**  Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. **2** We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things. **3** Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God? **4** Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? **5** But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.  
    
    **6** He will render to each one according to his works: **7** to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; **8** but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. **9** There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, **10** but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. **11** For God shows no partiality.  
    
    **12** For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. **13** For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. **14** For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. **15** They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them **16** on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.  
    
    **17** But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God **18** and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; **19** and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, **20** an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth— **21** you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? **22** You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? **23** You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. **24** For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”  
    
    **25** For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. **26** So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? **27** Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. **28** For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. **29** But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.  
      




!!! Caution "Be careful about hasty application here..."
    Paul is setting up different arguments here and some of the statements made in chapter 2 are points along a line that lead to final points written later. Be careful not to hastily make some conclusions from this text. For example you can find that it says, `the doers of the law ... will be justified`. The statement itself is true but has a broader context. Paul is using points like this to draw the audience into other conclusions. In Chapter 3 it becomes obvious that even though the above statement is true, the reality is that no one is good and no one is justified by doing the law.


## 2:1-11 God shows no Partiality

### Observations and Notes
- Paul speaks here to those who think they are generally 'moral' people. The assumption is that they are proud of themselves for not being like those described in Romans 1.
- 2:1 - `practice the same things` - the 'moral' person is the same as the 'immoral' person in Romans 1. The condemnation given here is about practicing the same things, not about judging. The conduct might not be exactly the same, but sin is sin.
- 2:5 - "day of wrath" = "day of the Lord" in the Old Testament. This is a day when God sits as judge in his court and judges the world by his justice.
- God's impartiality was one of the most commonly stressed doctrines of Judaism 

### Questions and Application
1. What kind of judgement is this in 2:6-11? Is it about eternal judgement? 
    - Consider that it says `eternal life` in verse 7 and it is evidential.

2. What kind of person does this passage describe?
    - a moral person that sins (2:1)
    - a person that thinks they are superior to obviously immoral people (2:1)
    - a person who thinks they deserve God's kindness because of their behavior
    - a person who cannot escape God's judgement just because of being moral (2:4)

3. How does God's kindness lead to repentance? (2:4)

4. What is the point of this passage?
    - the 'moral' person is just as guilty as an 'immoral' person and just as deserving of God's wrath

5. Is there anyone that is good (2:7) and not bad (2:8)?
    - See Romans 3:23 "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"
    - The point in 2:6-11 is that God is not partial. God will render to all according to their work. The immoral man, the moral man, and even the Jew. In other words, just because you are good does not mean you can escape God's judgement.

## 2:12-16 Stricter Judgment
### Observations and Notes
- it says `the work of the law is written on their hearts` not `the law is written on their hearts` in 2:15. This seems to be connected to the conscience.


### Questions and Application
1. What is the main point of 2:12-13?
    - The person who has the law might think he is safe from judgement, but he is not.
    - The gentile who doesn't have the law might think he is exempt from judgement, but he is not.
    - Only the does of the law are justified.

2. Is God fair to condemn those who have never heard the gospel or who do not have the law? (2:12)
    - 2:12-16 shows us that, Gentile or Jew, people are judged according to the standards that they know. Gentiles might not have the law, but they have the work of the law written on their hearts and a working conscience. People have an innate knowledge of right and wrong, but this is not explicit like written law.
    - Many pagan authors of Paul's day referred to the "unwritten law" within man.
    - This passage does not support moral subjectivism. `...they are a law to themselves` is not the same as `they make a law for themselves`
    - While Paul writes that a Gentile can potentially do the things contained in the law, he does not write that a Gentile could fulfill the requirements of the law by nature (or by his own effort).

3. How does this passage help us with evangelism?
    - It gives us more understand of the condition and destination of the lost.
    - No one is without excuse before God - whether they know the law or not.
    - There is a day when God will judge.


## 2:17-24 Disobeying the Law
### Observations and Notes
- The style of argument here is diatribe. It was often used to teach and exhort rather than to attack. To use this argument style an imaginary opponent represents an idealized wrong position and the speaker or writer then reduces this position to its most absurd logical conclusion. In 2:17~ the 'opponent' is the idealized hypocrite, and yet reveals the evils of any hypocrite.
- Diatribe often used pointed rhetorical questions as you can see in 2:21-23
- Temple robbery was considered one of the most shameful crimes
- The quote in 2:24 is from Ezekiel 36:20-23 (see below)


### Questions and Application
1. Who is Paul writing to in 2:17-24 and what is his main point here?
    - He is writing to the Jews who have the law and know what living a good moral life requires.
    - Jews also have the opportunity to pass the law on to others.
    - His point is in 2:23 - `You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.` This is proven more by how God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of the Jews.

2. Is the name of God blasphemed among non-Christians because of Christian behavior? 


## 2:25-29 True Jews

### Observations and Notes
- In Paul's time, some Rabbis taught that: 
    - Abraham sat at the entrance of hell and made certain that none of his circumcised descendants went there.
    - God will judge the Gentiles with one measure and the Jews with another
    - All Israelites will have part in the world to come.
- Circumcision (and also baptism) is like having a a label on a can of food. 

### Questions and Application

1. Why does Paul want to make this point?
    - Some Jews may have relied on the fact that they were circumcised as a safety net. 
    - Paul wanted to show that their circumcision didn't matter if they were disobedient.
    - Furthermore, a true Jew was one inwardly - a matter of the heart, not of some outward action (according to law).
    - See Deuteronomy 10:16

2. Perhaps one could point these same issues out about Christians. Who is a true Christian? What kind of religious activities do Christians cling on to for a false sense of eternal security rather than having a transformed heart?

**[William Newell](https://ccel.org/ccel/newell/romans/romans.iii.html)** summarized Romans 2 with "Seven Great Principles of God's Judgment":

1. God's judgment is according to truth (Romans 2:2).
2. God's judgment is according to accumulated guilt (Romans 2:5).
3. God's judgment is according to works (Romans 2:6).
4. God's judgment is without partiality (Romans 2:11).
5. God's judgment is according to performance, not knowledge (Romans 2:13).
6. God's judgment reaches the secrets of the heart (Romans 2:16).
7. God's judgment is according to reality, not religious profession (Romans 2:17-29).

!!! Scripture "Ezekiel 36:20-23 (ESV)"
    **20** But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, ‘These are the people of the Lord, and yet they had to go out of his land.’ **21** But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.  
    
    **22** “Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. **23** And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Lord God, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.  

!!! Scripture "Deuteronomy 10:16 (ESV)"
    **16** Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.
