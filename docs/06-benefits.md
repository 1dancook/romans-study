# Benefits of Being Justified (Romans 5:1-11)

### Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Romans 5:1-11 (ESV)"
    **1**  Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. **2** Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. **3** Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, **4** and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, **5** and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.  
    
    **6** For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. **7** For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— **8** but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. **9** Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. **10** For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. **11** More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.  

## Believers are declared Righteous

Paul continues here to expand and apply his example of Abraham to the readers from 4:23-5:11. 

One can note that Paul is equating Abraham being declared righteous by faith to believers being justified by faith. It is synonymous. This emphasizes the point from 1:18 - that the righteouesness that is revealed in the gospel is the way in which God treats a person as if he has never sinned.

This passage start to apply the points that have been established to the believer. 

### Observations and Notes
- 5:3-4 has a progression which is a literary and rhetorical form called concatenation. 
- In many Jewish traditions, the Holy Spirit was only available to people that were most worthy. In this passage the Holy Spirit is given as a gift (grace)
- Regarding the wrath of God, read 1:18

### Questions and Application
1. What does `justified` mean? 5:1, 5:9
    - this is legal terminology
    - we were guilty of sin and deserving of punishment
    - being justified means no longer being declared guilty and therefore no longer deserving of punishment
    - the issue of crime (sin) in God's court is satisfied by what Jesus did, so the believer is free
    - it means that we do not have to prove anything to God, Jesus did that for us
2. What does `peace` mean in 5:1?
    - `peace` here is in the context of relationship, rather than a feeling or description of atmosphere.
    - having peace with God means that we are now on his side. We are no longer enemies. 
    - this is a result of being justified
3. Why should a believer rejoice in sufferings? (5:3~)
    - This leads to having confident hope in God's salvation - this kind of hope will not lead us to being disappointed.
    - we can flip this around and say that the ability to have hope doesn't come without character. Good character is not made without first enduring. Enduring is not experienced without suffering.
4. What does being `reconciled` mean? 5:10-11
    - two people that are in opposition to each other being made friends again
5. What does this passage tell you about who you were *before* you were saved? Do you still believe those things about you?
6. This passage defines many things for the Believer. It helps us to understand our identity in Christ. Write down a list of all the things that define you according to this passage. These are all things that are only possible because of what Jesus has done. **Because of Jesus ...**
