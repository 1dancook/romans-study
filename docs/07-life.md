# Death in Adam, Life in Christ (Romans 5:12-21)

### Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Romans 5:12-21 (ESV)"
    **12** Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinnedâ€” **13** for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. **14** Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.  
    
    **15** But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. **16** And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. **17** For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.  
    
    **18** Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. **19** For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous. **20** Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, **21** so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.


Paul in this section shows that justification by grace reaches and affects us in Christ much more than sin and death affect us in Adam.


### Observations and Notes
- All people (Jewish and Gentile) have common decent from Adam. This ties in with the theme from previous chapters that all people are sinners.
- For Jewish readers, Paul's argument would have been quite strong since in their traditions Adam was quite prominent.
- Adam is a `type of the one who was to come` - Adam and Jesus have both universal signficance for humanity.
- `because all sinned` in verse 12 is difficult to interpret - but it is more likely that this refers to all people sinning "in Adam." This carries the meaning that either Adam was the 'head' of all humanity and acted on our behalf, or that since he is the father of all humanity, we are 'in him'. 
- Paul is not sharing new thoughts about Adam and his trespass. Jewish people in this period believed that Adam's sin introduced sin and then also death to the world. They believed that all descendants shared in Adam's guilt.
- Notice in verse 12 Paul starts with `just as`. Usually this will be like "Just as A, B", but Paul has a discussion about A and doesn't get to B until verse 15. In other words, Just as sin came into the world through one man, grace  abounded to many through the obedience of one man.

### Questions and Application
1. What does this passage tell us about the origins of sin and death?
    - sin came into the world through one man (Adam)
    - death came through sin
    - death spread to all people. Why? Because they all sinned.
    - this tells us that the result of sin is death, and that all people experience this.
    - sin was in the world before there was law
    - Paul is not denying personal responsibility for sin by pointing here to Adam.
    - death reigned from Adam to Moses
    - All people are born spiritually dead (See Ephesians 2:1-3).
    - Adam's sin had this broad effect because he was a type of the one to come. Jesus and Adam both represented all of humanity but the results were greatly different. Both Adam and Jesus are in an interesting position as their lives affected all humanity.
    - judgment following Adam's trespass brought condemnation
    - death reigned
    - led to condemnation for all men

2. In contrast, what was the result of the free gift from Jesus?
    - God's grace and free gift abounded for many
    - the free gift brought justification
    - reign in life (for those who receive)
    - leads to justification and life for all men
    - many will be made righteous
    - the justification/righteousness results in eternal life

3. What about you? What is your current identity based on this?
    - Look at verse from 1 Corinthians 15:21-22
    - If you are no longer in Adam, and you are in Christ, what does that mean?
    - "I am ..."

4. When sharing the gospel, this passage again reinforces the point that `all have sinned and have fallen short of God's glory.` It also reinforces the great affect that Jesus' death had.
