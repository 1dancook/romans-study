So they are without excuse. 21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. 24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, 25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. 26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. 28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. 29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them. Wilful Idolatry 1:18-23 Observations and Notes 1:18 The phrase the wrath of God is revealed from heaven is basically a way of saying, God is angry . In contrast to verse 17 - The righteousness of God is revealed here the wrath of God is revealed . 1:19-22 Even philosophers at the time argued that humanity was not in a position to deny the existence of the gods and that the human mind points to what God is like. Jewish evangelism of gentiles also utilized this reasoning (all people know that God or gods exist) and they wanted to help people know the one true God. Questions and Application Does \"God is wrathful\" fit into your view of God? What does this mean exactly? We can easily have an idealistic, romantic notion of who God is and what he is like. The Bible is not like this. The concept of God being wrathful has to be understood in the context of God being in relationship to creation. The backdrop to this passage is Genesis 3 and the idea of mankind's refusal to live in relationship with God and instead grasp to become him According to the narrative of Genesis 3\u201311, the denial of dependence on and accountability to God results in growing corruption within society. The wrath of God is referred to as a future event (Rom 2:5, 8, 5:9; Eph 5:6, 1 Thess 1:10, 5:9). In this context it is an activity. God's wrath in this context is his response to sin but it is not vindictive or malicious - his response is just. In 1:18 this wrath of God is something that is currently being revealed. It is indirect rather than direct. It's an expression of God's permissive will and not his active will. He is not shown in this passage to be actively responding to human sin. Sinful actions bear fruit to more and more corruption, and this becomes in itself a penalty for sin. This passage means to show that this entire downward spiral is God's punishment that we administer to ourselves. This really gives us a back drop to the need of the gospel. We were like this. Hopeless in our sin. God's wrath was shown against us and gave us up to our own sinful passions and desires. But he loves us and so he did something about it even though we didn't deserve it. 1:18 - what is the truth that the wicked suppress? How do they do this? The suppress the truth about who God is, namely, his character (1:19-20) They do it by their unrighteousness (1:18) They do it by idolatry (1:23) worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator (1:25) 1:19- For the gentiles, what can be known about God and how can it be known? What can be known: eternal power (20) divine nature (20) How? it is plain to them (19) because God showed them In the things that have been made. In other words, creation reveals God's eternal power and divine nature. Since when? Since the creation of the world What does it mean \"they are without excuse?\" (20) In verse 21 it is clear - even though they knew God they did not honor him. They have no excuse for living apart from God and becoming so corrupt. Even though people know God, what happened to them for not honoring him? they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. they became fools (even though they though they were wise) How does this passage help us in evangelism? Other Sinful Actions (1:24-32) A big point here is that distorting one's view about God's character perverts one's sexuality and sexual treatment of other people. Ancient Jewish people recognized two things about the gentiles: idolatry and sexual immorality. Observations and Notes 1:24, 26, 28 The phrase God gave them up occurs three times. There are reasons attached. 1:28 debased originally meant 'something that has not passed the test.' This was used for measuring if coins were made to standard. If not, they were rejected. A man that has a debased mind has an unapproved mind. Questions and Application God gave them up occurs three times. What are the reasons for this? 24: idolatry - exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images... (1:23) also idolatry verse 25. 26: idolatry - they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature... (1:25) 28: did not acknowledge God (1:28) What did God 'give them up' in or to? 24: in the lusts of their hearts which led to: to impurity to dishonoring of their bodies among themselves 26: to dishonorable passions which led to: women having unnatural relations note the 'likewise' in verse 27 men having unnatural relations 28: to a debased mind which led to: to do what ought not to be done filled with all manner of unrighteousness (big list from 29-31) What does this mean that God gave them up in verse 24, 26, 28? It is about how God's wrath works he lets people bring more corruption and condemnation on themselves as they warp their own humanity some writers call this 'penal blindness' What does this passage tell us about homosexuality? The clear point of this passage is that homosexuality is a result of idolatry. Then because of idolatry God has given people over to dishonorable passions. It is sin. It is unnatural. What this passage says is simple and not hard to understand. It is a difficult topic not because of what the Bible says but because of how society disagrees with it so much. The fact that society dislikes what scripture says about homosexuality underscores one of the points of this passage - people having a debased mind and approving of sinful practices. Other notes: The culture at the time openly approved of homosexuality Greek men were commonly bisexual elements of Greek culture helped boys to grow into homosexuality men openly practised homosexuality with young boys legal marriage between same sex couples was recognized The emperor Nero got a boy, castrated him, and married him (full ceremony). The boy became his 'wife'. Later, Nero lived with another man and Nero was the 'wife'. What is the gentile view of these unrighteous practices? (1:32) they know it is wrong they do it anyway they give approval to those who who practice them God gives them over to a debased mind so that the things that are sinful are accepted and approved. What does this passage show us about the root of sin? It is idolatry How can we use this passage to show people their need for the gospel?","title":"God's wrath against Gentiles (1:18-32)"},{"location":"02-wrath-gentiles.html#gods-wrath-against-gentiles-romans-118-32","text":"","title":"God's Wrath against Gentiles (Romans 1:18-32)"},{"location":"02-wrath-gentiles.html#main-passage","text":"Romans 1:18-32 (ESV) 18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. 19 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. 20 For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.

The clear point of this passage is that homosexuality is a result of idolatry. Then because of idolatry God has given people over to dishonorable passions. It is sin. It is unnatural. What this passage says is simple and not hard to understand. It is a difficult topic not because of what the Bible says but because of how society disagrees with it so much. The fact that society dislikes what scripture says about homosexuality underscores one of the points of this passage - people having a debased mind and approving of sinful practices. Other notes: The culture at the time openly approved of homosexuality Greek men were commonly bisexual elements of Greek culture helped boys to grow into homosexuality men openly practised homosexuality with young boys legal marriage between same sex couples was recognized The emperor Nero got a boy, castrated him, and married him (full ceremony). The boy became his 'wife'. Later, Nero lived with another man and Nero was the 'wife'. What is the gentile view of these unrighteous practices? (1:32) they know it is wrong they do it anyway they give approval to those who who practice them God gives them over to a debased mind so that the things that are sinful are accepted and approved. What does this passage show us about the root of sin? It is idolatry How can we use this passage to show people their need for the gospel?","title":"Questions and Application"},{"location":"03-wrath-jews.html","text":"God's Wrath against Moralists and Jews (2:1-29) Main Passage Romans 2:1-29 (ESV) 1 Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. 2 We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things. 3 Do you suppose, O man\u2014you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself\u2014that you will escape the judgment of God? 4 Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? 5 But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. 6 He will render to each one according to his works: 7 to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; 8 but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. 9 There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, 10 but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. 11 For God shows no partiality. 12 For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. 13 For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. 14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them 16 on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus. 17 But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God 18 and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; 19 and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth\u2014 21 you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? 22 You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 23 You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. 24 For, as it is written, \u201cThe name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.\u201d 25 For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. 26 So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? 27 Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. 28 For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. 29 But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God. Be careful about hasty application here... Paul is setting up different arguments here and some of the statements made in chapter 2 are points along a line that lead to final points written later. Be careful not to hastily make some conclusions from this text. For example you can find that it says, the doers of the law ... will be justified . The statement itself is true but has a broader context. Paul is using points like this to draw the audience into other conclusions. In Chapter 3 it becomes obvious that even though the above statement is true, the reality is that no one is good and no one is justified by doing the law. 2:1-11 God shows no Partiality Observations and Notes Paul speaks here to those who think they are generally 'moral' people. The assumption is that they are proud of themselves for not being like those described in Romans 1. 2:1 - practice the same things - the 'moral' person is the same as the 'immoral' person in Romans 1. The condemnation given here is about practicing the same things, not about judging. The conduct might not be exactly the same, but sin is sin. 2:5 - \"day of wrath\" = \"day of the Lord\" in the Old Testament. This is a day when God sits as judge in his court and judges the world by his justice. God's impartiality was one of the most commonly stressed doctrines of Judaism Questions and Application What kind of judgement is this in 2:6-11? Is it about eternal judgement? Consider that it says eternal life in verse 7 and it is evidential. What kind of person does this passage describe? a moral person that sins (2:1) a person that thinks they are superior to obviously immoral people (2:1) a person who thinks they deserve God's kindness because of their behavior a person who cannot escape God's judgement just because of being moral (2:4) How does God's kindness lead to repentance? (2:4) What is the point of this passage? the 'moral' person is just as guilty as an 'immoral' person and just as deserving of God's wrath Is there anyone that is good (2:7) and not bad (2:8)? See Romans 3:23 \"all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" The point in 2:6-11 is that God is not partial. God will render to all according to their work. The immoral man, the moral man, and even the Jew. In other words, just because you are good does not mean you can escape God's judgement. 2:12-16 Stricter Judgment Observations and Notes it says the work of the law is written on their hearts not the law is written on their hearts in 2:15. This seems to be connected to the conscience. Questions and Application What is the main point of 2:12-13? The person who has the law might think he is safe from judgement, but he is not. The gentile who doesn't have the law might think he is exempt from judgement, but he is not. Only the does of the law are justified. Is God fair to condemn those who have never heard the gospel or who do not have the law? (2:12) 2:12-16 shows us that, Gentile or Jew, people are judged according to the standards that they know. Gentiles might not have the law, but they have the work of the law written on their hearts and a working conscience. People have an innate knowledge of right and wrong, but this is not explicit like written law. Many pagan authors of Paul's day referred to the \"unwritten law\" within man. This passage does not support moral subjectivism. ...they are a law to themselves is not the same as they make a law for themselves While Paul writes that a Gentile can potentially do the things contained in the law, he does not write that a Gentile could fulfill the requirements of the law by nature (or by his own effort). How does this passage help us with evangelism? It gives us more understand of the condition and destination of the lost. No one is without excuse before God - whether they know the law or not. There is a day when God will judge. 2:17-24 Disobeying the Law Observations and Notes The style of argument here is diatribe. It was often used to teach and exhort rather than to attack. To use this argument style an imaginary opponent represents an idealized wrong position and the speaker or writer then reduces this position to its most absurd logical conclusion. In 2:17~ the 'opponent' is the idealized hypocrite, and yet reveals the evils of any hypocrite. Diatribe often used pointed rhetorical questions as you can see in 2:21-23 Temple robbery was considered one of the most shameful crimes The quote in 2:24 is from Ezekiel 36:20-23 (see below) Questions and Application Who is Paul writing to in 2:17-24 and what is his main point here? He is writing to the Jews who have the law and know what living a good moral life requires. Jews also have the opportunity to pass the law on to others. His point is in 2:23 - You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. This is proven more by how God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of the Jews. Is the name of God blasphemed among non-Christians because of Christian behavior? 2:25-29 True Jews Observations and Notes In Paul's time, some Rabbis taught that: Abraham sat at the entrance of hell and made certain that none of his circumcised descendants went there. God will judge the Gentiles with one measure and the Jews with another All Israelites will have part in the world to come. Circumcision (and also baptism) is like having a a label on a can of food. Questions and Application Why does Paul want to make this point? Some Jews may have relied on the fact that they were circumcised as a safety net. Paul wanted to show that their circumcision didn't matter if they were disobedient. Furthermore, a true Jew was one inwardly - a matter of the heart, not of some outward action (according to law). See Deuteronomy 10:16 Perhaps one could point these same issues out about Christians. Who is a true Christian? What kind of religious activities do Christians cling on to for a false sense of eternal security rather than having a transformed heart? William Newell summarized Romans 2 with \"Seven Great Principles of God's Judgment\": God's judgment is according to truth (Romans 2:2). God's judgment is according to accumulated guilt (Romans 2:5). God's judgment is according to works (Romans 2:6). God's judgment is without partiality (Romans 2:11). God's judgment is according to performance, not knowledge (Romans 2:13). God's judgment reaches the secrets of the heart (Romans 2:16). God's judgment is according to reality, not religious profession (Romans 2:17-29). Ezekiel 36:20-23 (ESV) 20 But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, \u2018These are the people of the Lord, and yet they had to go out of his land.\u2019 21 But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came. 22 \u201cTherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. 23 And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Lord God, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. Deuteronomy 10:16 (ESV) 16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.","title":"God's wrath against Moralists & Jews (2:1-29)"},{"location":"03-wrath-jews.html#gods-wrath-against-moralists-and-jews-21-29","text":"","title":"God's Wrath against Moralists and Jews (2:1-29)"},{"location":"03-wrath-jews.html#main-passage","text":"Romans 2:1-29 (ESV) 1 Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges.

Or what is the value of circumcision? 2 Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. 3 What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? 4 By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, \u201cThat you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.\u201d 5 But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) 6 By no means! For then how could God judge the world? 7 But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? 8 And why not do evil that good may come?\u2014as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just. 9 What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, 10 as it is written: \u201cNone is righteous, no, not one; 11 no one understands; no one seeks for God. 12 All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.\u201d 13 \u201cTheir throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.\u201d \u201cThe venom of asps is under their lips.\u201d 14 \u201cTheir mouth is full of curses and bitterness.\u201d 15 \u201cTheir feet are swift to shed blood; 16 in their paths are ruin and misery, 17 and the way of peace they have not known.\u201d 18 \u201cThere is no fear of God before their eyes.\u201d 19 Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. 20 For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. 21 But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it\u2014 22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. 26 It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. 27 Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. 28 For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. 29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, 30 since God is one\u2014who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. 31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law. 3:1-8 God is Justified in his Judgement Observations and Notes The issue here is that Israel was unfaithful to the covenant, not that God was unfaithful. 3:4 - \"By no means!\" is shows the absurdity of the opposing objection. 3:4 - the quote is from Psalm 51:4 in which David confesses and reflects on his sin of adultery with Bathsheba. God is justified in judging sin. Questions and Application From the previous lessons we see that all are under God's wrath. What advantage do the Jews have? 3:2 - they were entrusted with the oracles of God . They were given the revelation of God. Romans 9:4 (ESV) They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises. Does the unfaithfulness of people make God unfaithful? The answer is an obvious no, but think about the issue for a moment. There are often times that people have issues in their life and may blame God - implying that he wasn't faithful. Do you blame God for your own unfaithfulness? What does it mean our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God ? righteousness of God refers to his justice God will judge sin and in the act of judging reveals more about who he is. Therefore there is some good that comes out of our evil. The question then becomes - if my sinful living is giving God glory, why would I be condemned for that? Isn't it a good result? There is a line of thinking that goes like this: \"God is in control of everything. Even my evil will ultimately demonstrate His righteousness. Therefore God is unjust if He inflicts His wrath on me, because I'm just a pawn in His hand.\" A person is not given credit for doing evil - even if God brought some good out of their evil. That person still stands guilty before God. Note: 3:8 - if some are teaching \"do evil so that good will come\" then condemnation for that teaching is just. 3:9-18 Hammering the Point with Scripture Paul strings together some texts (refered to as \"pearl stringing\") to bring home the points he has been making. Stringing together texts like this was common in the opening of synagogue homilies and also evidenced in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Observations and Notes 3:9 - What then? is a common rhetorical question that is used to advance the argument in a diatribe. 3:9 - being 'under' sin is synonymous with being under its rule. It may be intentional that Paul mentions more things here about 'mouth' related issues (3:13-14). It's potentially related to the Roman Christians complaining about each other (Romans 14). Questions and Application What does it mean that \"both Jews and Greeks\" are \"under sin\"? (3:9) Being 'under' means being 'ruled'. Jews and Gentiles together are under the rule of sin. This speaks of being in slavery to sin and having the inability to break free. Paul strings together different scriptures in 3:10-18 to further the point that \"all are under sin\". Quotes from: Psalm 14:1-3 Psalm 5:9 Psalm 140:3 Psalm 10:7 Isaiah 59:7-8 Psalm 36:1 What are some big points here? No one is righteous No one understands No one seeks God All have turn aside All have become worthless (together) No one does good Everyone speaks lies, curses, and bitterness Everyone's actions bring about bloodshed, ruin and misery. No one knows the way of peace. No one fears God. This is a swift condemnation of all people. If anyone thinks they have some semblance of goodness, these verses would shut them up. What body parts do you see mentioned? Why is there so much mention of body parts? Throat, tongue, lips, mouth, feet, eyes. Jewish teachers emphasized that evil ruled body parts. How does this passage helps us with evangelism? 3:19-31 The Righteousness of God Revealed A Jewish reader might contend with the point that all are sinners by saying that he is justified by the works of the law. Paul's writing here shows again that Jews and Gentiles are on the same level ground. God's righteousness is not moved or swayed by one's obedience to the law (Jew) or even by one's disobedience (Gentile). It is instead received by faith in Christ and this is for both the Jew and the Gentile. Observations and Notes 3:21 - But now... indicates a big shift in Paul's argument. 3:21 - the Law and the Prophets indicates whole Old Testament 3:23 - fall short of the glory of God may be about the Jewish idea that when Adam sinned, humanity lost the glory of God (and so each generation repeates Adam's sin). It could also simply mean that no one lives up to God's standards. 3:27 - boasting is about the Jews being able to boast about salvation and having something better or more than Gentiles. Questions and Application A Jew might counter Paul's point that \"all are under sin\" by saying \"But I am justified by the law.\" How does Paul counter that point in 3:19-20? The law speaks to those under (ruled by) the law and does not provide any excuse. Instead it holds all the world accountable to God. Obedience to the law cannot justify someone before God because it points out sin. The law was never intended as a means of salvation or justification. Since the Jew cannot be justified by the law, it points to a much greater need Do you think that obedience to the 'law' or 'rules' found throughout the Bible will justify you before God? Sometimes Christians feel as though they need good works to feel justified before God. They don't want to feel the weight of guilt for their sin and then turn to good works in an attempt to justify themselves. This is not possible to do, even though many try. What is meant by the righteousness of God in 3:21-26? This was also mentioned in 1:17 and it is about how God treats the sinner as if he had not been a sinner at all. It is his vindication of the sinner. It is all about the work of Jesus Christ How is God's righteousness revealed? All that is written and spoken in the Old Testament law and the prophets is not able to vindicate a person. It shows the reader that they cannot rely on the law for justification. Instead, the law and the prophets point to how God's righteousness is revealed. How is God's righteousness received? 3:22 - it is through faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the object of faith here. 3:24-25 - it is a gift that is received by faith What does God's righteousness do for the recipient (3:24-25)? The recipient is justified by his grace . \"Justification\" is a court term. Sinners stand before God the Judge as condemned. Those who have faith in what Jesus has done are justified. By his gift of grace God declares believers \"not guilty\". A persons 'good work' has no merit here. The recipient is redeemed . \"Redemption\" is a term from the slave market and an Old Testament concept. To free a slave or to get something back always required paying a price. Christians are purchased by God. They are freed from being slaves to sin. The price was the death of Christ. The recipient is propitiated for by Jesus' blood \"Propitiation\" is a term that is borrowed from temple rituals. It is used to refer to the act of sacrificing an animal on behalf of someone. This act would turn away God's wrath. The mercy seat (the cover of the ark of the covenant) was all about propitiation. God's mercy was found in the holy of holies but it required the right sacrifice/blood. There had to be a satisfactory sacrifice. This was necessary for reconiliation between people and God. (God passing over sins before is in anticipation of the work of Jesus on the cross) Jesus came under God's wrath on our behalf and his wrath is satisfied. His wrath against us is therefore turned away because of Jesus' blood. Who can receive God's righteousness? 3:22 - all who believe , there is no distinction shows that this is for both the Jew and the Gentile - anyone who will receive Jesus by faith 3:30 - both Jew and Gentile can be justified by faith Someone might say, \"if the law can't justify us, then we don't need it!\". Does the way that God's righteouesness is revealed in the gospel destroy the law? 3:31 - No. Paul uses the next part to show why - the gospel establishes the law, fulfilling its own predictions.","title":"God's Righteousness through Faith in Christ (3:1-31)"},{"location":"04-christ.html#gods-righteousness-through-faith-in-christ-31-31","text":"","title":"God's Righteousness through Faith in Christ (3:1-31)"},{"location":"04-christ.html#main-passage","text":"Romans 3:1-31 (ESV) 3:1 Then what advantage has the Jew?

Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? 4 By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, \u201cThat you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.\u201d 5 But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) 6 By no means!

Their condemnation is just. 9 What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, 10 as it is written: \u201cNone is righteous, no, not one; 11 no one understands; no one seeks for God. 12 All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.\u201d 13 \u201cTheir throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.\u201d \u201cThe venom of asps is under their lips.\u201d 14 \u201cTheir mouth is full of curses and bitterness.\u201d 15 \u201cTheir feet are swift to shed blood; 16 in their paths are ruin and misery, 17 and the way of peace they have not known.\u201d 18 \u201cThere is no fear of God before their eyes.\u201d 19 Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. 20 For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. 21 But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it\u2014 22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. 26 It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. 27 Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. 28 For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. 29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, 30 since God is one\u2014who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. 31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means!

There are often times that people have issues in their life and may blame God - implying that he wasn't faithful. Do you blame God for your own unfaithfulness? What does it mean our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God ? righteousness of God refers to his justice God will judge sin and in the act of judging reveals more about who he is. Therefore there is some good that comes out of our evil. The question then becomes - if my sinful living is giving God glory, why would I be condemned for that? Isn't it a good result? There is a line of thinking that goes like this: \"God is in control of everything. Even my evil will ultimately demonstrate His righteousness. Therefore God is unjust if He inflicts His wrath on me, because I'm just a pawn in His hand.\" A person is not given credit for doing evil - even if God brought some good out of their evil.

We are no longer enemies. this is a result of being justified Why should a believer rejoice in sufferings? (5:3~) This leads to having confident hope in God's salvation - this kind of hope will not lead us to being disappointed. we can flip this around and say that the ability to have hope doesn't come without character. Good character is not made without first enduring. Enduring is not experienced without suffering. What does being reconciled mean? 5:10-11 two people that are in opposition to each other being made friends again What does this passage tell you about who you were before you were saved?
